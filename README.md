# Bidirectional Cross-Modal Collaborative Alignment via Semantic-Guided Visual Embeddings for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval

## 1.Introduction
[IEEE TIP 2026]

Official implementation of paper:

Bidirectional Cross-Modal Collaborative Alignment via Semantic-Guided Visual Embeddings for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval

### Core idea
![](./assets/Idea.png)

Core idea for addressing the challenges in PRVR. Semantic–visual association library serves not only as a bridge to mitigate modality gaps but also
provides the foundation for generating dynamic visual anchors to address partial mismatches between textual and video content.

### Overview
![](./assets/Framework.png)

Overview of the proposed architecture. We cluster keywords from the textual query set to construct a SVAL. Relevant visual features are selected
based on their similarity to query features and used to update the library. The SGFP encodes visual features with the help of dynamically retrieved semantic
anchors. In the VITL, semantic-level visual features are concatenated with textual features for joint encoding, reducing the vision-language modality gap.
